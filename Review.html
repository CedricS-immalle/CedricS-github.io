	  <h3 id="Centreer">  Review of Barco's ClickShare </h3>
	<p id="Veeltekst">
	On the first day when I arrived at Van Roey they showed me a device they used for presentations or for meetings. It was called  ClickShare, I never heard of it before. Turns out it is a Belgian company as well! It is a little device that is placed behind the television or the screen, it connects with another little device that you plug in to your computer, then you select the right operating system and then its shows your screen on the television!

	Don’t forget to push the button on the device, that’s what makes it show on the screen. It is really great because you do not  have to deal with the wires from something like a beamer anymore. You can also move around freely if you like. Just as the article describes, you can just plug it in and start ‘playing’. The reason I chose this article is because it had 4.5 stars on Google and it was the first one, the site looked reliable, and It is called PC Advisor, so it can’t be bad, right?   The article also explains how you have to setup the device so you can use it, how you can give it a wallpaper as well. The review describes the device as an easy to use device that you can plug in and press the button and start presenting right away. Also it praises the fact that you “can join an already active ClickShare session, and it will divide the screen neatly so all participating desktops will be visible. It provides both the opportunity for multiple presentations, as well as providing a very neat transition between presenters.” The review also briefly talks about the negative things, for example that video playback is limited to 30fps and for HDMI there is no audio support, so you’ll have to use a separate sound system. Also the USB ports can only be used to apply updates, there’s no media support at present they say.

	The thing I like about the article is that it starts with what it is and how you have to install it, also it says what operating systems it supports, even smartphones. The thing I dislike about the article is that they mostly talk about the good things only, and at the end of the article it concludes with some things that are bad about it. But maybe because there aren’t really any other products like this. It does not really want to describe the bad things. Overall I think it is a great tool to use if you want your presentations to go smoothly, you don’t have to download anything so that Is a very nice thing as well, so you can start presenting right away!
