      <h3 id="Centreer">  IT AND ME </h3>
      
<p id="Veeltekst">
My first experience with IT was many years ago, when I was young I played video games on an old computer and a gaming console. I was 6 years old, back then it was just something to play games on.
My first impressions weren’t that great, as I said it was just a device to play games on, but later on I started seeing how much you could do with it. Not just games but all sorts of other stuff, for example you could talk to people, watch videos, read the news, and much more.

Now I spend a lot of hours every week on my computer, not every day but about 4-5 days every week. A lot of time I spend playing games, as well as working for school, or just browsing the web for interesting things. The thing I achieved so far is that I assembled a computer, with some help of course. Over the years I think I have made an evolution, in my use of pc. Because I learned how to type, which helped a lot, as well how to close tabs and things like that with shortcuts. It might take some time before you start to do it without noticing it, but it’s really helpful when you finally are able to do it! I wouldn’t call myself an expert, but at least I am a lot faster and better than I used to be, an advanced user maybe, that sounds okay. The things that I started to find fascinating since I learned how to program is that behind every website there is a file with code or something like that, behind everything over the internet, and I think it is very fascinating how people made it, and still invent new ways to make your IT-experience better. And now when you look back at the people who were the first to use computers and invent things, you really can see how far we have already come in such a short time, and with the computers they used to do stuff. It's just amazing actually when you really look back at it.

I don’t really have any ambitions in IT. It would be nice if I could study something in IT, but I certainly would consider doing something else, because there are a lot of interesting things to choose from. But I still have some time. And after that we’ll see if I can get a job in which some IT skills are required, that would be very nice. 
</p>

To conclude, IT has become a big part of my life, because I follow it at school of course, but as well because in my free time I spend a lot of time doing IT related stuff.

And for the picture. If I can remember right, we were installing our virtual machines.
